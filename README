Crosswalk Brackets Extension
----------------------------

This directory contains code to build an extension to allow running
Brackets[1] (an open source code editor) under Crosswalk.

Since the official Brackets shell focuses on Windows and MacOS X, this
plugin offers a solution that works under Linux. It implements most APIs
that Brackets shell implements, including I/O, menus, and live browser
previews.

Some things (such as file dialogs) are not implemented yet, but work is
underway in Crosswalk to support these. Consider this an early alpha
version.

How to Build
------------

Requirements:
 - GTK+-2.0 headers and libraries, with pkg-config
 - util-linux (for hexdump(1))
 - make
 - sed
 - a working C++ compiler/linker setup

Just run `make`. A `brackets.so` file should be created.

How to Use
----------

1. Follow the Brackets setup instructions;
2. Create a directory `extensions` under `src` inside Brackets;
3. Copy `brackets.so` to the `extensions` directory;
4. Run the `run-brackets.sh` script, passing the path to the Crosswalk
   executable and the directory where Brackets is located. For example:

        $ ./run-brackets.sh ~/chrome/out/Release/xwalk ~/brackets
